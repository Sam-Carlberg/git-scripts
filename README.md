# git-scripts
Miscellaneous shell scripts for making my life with Git easier

I use OS X Yosemite. These scripts may not work on Linux, and definitely won't work on Windows

## Using

Just run `./copyScripts.sh /path/to/dir`, where `path/to/dir` is the path to the directory you want the scripts to be copied to
(you may also need to run `chmod +x` on the copied scripts; I just use `sudo` when moving the scripts and it works fine)
